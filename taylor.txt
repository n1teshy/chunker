Life and career
Early life

Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor;[2] her parents chose a unisex name with hopes of her becoming successful in business.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] The siblings are of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[6][7][8] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer, whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music.[9]

During childhood, Swift spent her holiday seasons on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania,[10] and summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] Raised Christian,[12] she attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School in Pottstown.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] At age nine, she aspired to a career in musical theater, performing at local festivals and in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions,[17][18] and traveling regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she changed her goal and became determined to pursue a country music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21]

At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of a computer repairman and local musician who assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, she and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and was given an artist development deal from RCA Records at 13.[25][26] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[27][28] Swift attended Hendersonville High School for two years before transferring to Aaron Academy, which offered homeschooling.[3][29][30]
2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album

Swift signed to Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing in 2004; at 14, she became the youngest signee in the publishing company's history.[31] In Nashville, she worked with experienced Music Row songwriters, including Liz Rose.[32][33] Rose and Swift would write songs every Tuesday afternoon after school.[34] After one year on the development deal, she left RCA Records, who decided to keep her in development until she turned 18.[35] Swift decided so because she wanted to release the songs immediately, to make sure that they still resonated with her teenage experiences.[36]

Swift organized a showcase concert at Bluebird Cafe on November 3, 2004; among the attendees were Scott Borchetta, a music executive who was planning to establish an independent record label, Big Machine Records.[38] She signed a recording contract with Big Machine two weeks after the concert, on the condition that her albums would be written by herself;[39][40] her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company.[41] The contract finalized by July 2005, when Swift ended the working relationship with Dymtrow.[42] She spent four months near the end of 2005 to record her debut album, Taylor Swift, with the producer Nathan Chapman.[43]

Swift's debut single, "Tim McGraw", was released in June 2006. She and her mother spent mid-2006 sending promotional copies of the song to country radio stations across the US.[44] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[45] On the US Billboard 200 chart, the album peaked at number five and spent 157 weeks—the longest chart run by album in the 2000s decade.[46] With Taylor Swift, she became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[47] The album was promoted by a six-month radio tour and Swift's opening for other country artists including Rascal Flatts in 2006,[43][48] and George Strait,[49] Brad Paisley,[50] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill in 2007.[51] She opened for Rascal Flatts again in 2008,[52] when she dated the singer Joe Jonas.[53]

Taylor Swift was supported by four more singles in 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn", and "Should've Said No". "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" reached number one on the Hot Country Songs chart; with the former single, Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one country single.[54] "Teardrops on My Guitar" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts, reaching the top 10 of the Pop Songs, Adult Pop Songs, and Adult Contemporary charts.[55][56] Her next releases were the Christmas extended play (EP) The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007,[57] and the Walmart-exclusive EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58] Swift became the youngest person to be awarded with Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year, in 2007.[59] At the 50th Annual Grammy Awards in 2008, she was nominated for Best New Artist.[60]

Fearless became the most-awarded country album of all time.[70] It won the three highest awards for a country album: Album of the Year by both the Country Music Association Awards and Academy of Country Music Awards in 2009, and Best Country Album by the Grammy Awards in 2010.[71] At the Grammys, it also won Album of the Year, and "White Horse" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[72] Also in 2009, Swift was named Artist of the Year by both the American Music Awards and Billboard,[73][74] and Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association Awards, becoming the youngest person to win the honor.[75] "You Belong with Me" won Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became known as "Kanyegate" and turned into the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76]

Swift collaborated with other musicians in 2009. She featured on "Half of My Heart" by John Mayer, with whom she was romantically linked later that year.[77][78] She wrote "Best Days of Your Life" for Kellie Pickler,[79] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' "Two Is Better Than One,[80] and wrote and recorded "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier" for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[81][82] She had her acting debut in the 2010 rom-com Valentine's Day and wrote "Today Was a Fairytale" for its soundtrack.[83] "Today Was a Fairytale" reached number one on the Canadian Hot 100.[84] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[85] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[86] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host to write their own opening monologue.[87]

Swift wrote her third studio album, Speak Now, entirely herself.[88] Released on October 25, 2010,[89] Speak Now expands on the country pop sound of Fearless and incorporates strong rock music influences.[90] Speak Now debuted the US Billboard 200 with over one million first-week copies sold, registering the highest single-week tally for a female country artist.[91] Five of its singles—"Mine", "Back to December", "Mean", "Sparks Fly", and "Ours"—charted in the top three of Hot Country Songs; "Sparks Fly" and "Ours" reached number one.[68] "Mine" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100.[92]

On October 22, 2012, Swift released her fourth studio album, Red,[99] which featured collaborations with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker. Conceived as a record that expanded beyond Swift's country pop releases, Red incorporates eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop,[100][101] leading to a critical debate over Swift's status as a country musician.[102] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales, becoming the fastest-selling country album in US history.[103] It was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[104] During promotion of Red, Swift was romantically involved with the political heir Conor Kennedy, and subsequently the singer Harry Styles.[78]

Three of 1989's singles—"Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood"—reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100; the first two made Swift the first woman to replace herself at the top spot.[125] Two other singles—"Style" and "Wildest Dreams"—peaked at numbers six and five, making 1989 the first album by Swift to have five consecutive top-10 singles on the Hot 100.[126] The 1989 World Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2015 with $250 million in revenue.[127] She was named Billboard's Woman of the Year and received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards in 2014,[128][129] and "Bad Blood" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[130] At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards in 2016, 1989 made Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice; it also won Best Pop Vocal Album, and "Bad Blood" won Best Music Video.[131]

She published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in July 2014 to stress the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[132] and, in November, removed her discography from ad-supported, free streaming platforms such as Spotify.[133] Big Machine kept her music only on paid, subscription-required platforms.[134] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[135] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[136] Big Machine returned Swift's catalog to Spotify and other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[137]

Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[138] They co-wrote the EMD single "This Is What You Came For", which featured vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[139] "Better Man", the 2016 single which Swift wrote for the country vocal group Little Big Town, won the Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year.[140] She recorded "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to the 2017 film Fifty Shades Darker; the song became the highest-charting single from the Fifty Shades franchise on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.[141]

In April 2016, Kanye West released the single "Famous", in which he references Swift in the line, "I made that bitch famous." Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. Although the clips were proved to be purposefully edited,[142] the controversy made Swift a subject of an online "cancel" movement, where her critics denounced her as a fake and calculating "snake".[143] In late 2016, after briefly dating the actor Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with the actor Joe Alwyn and underwent a hiatus.[144][145]

In August 2017, Swift countersued and won a case against David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's seniors that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[146] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explores themes of fame, drama, and finding love amidst the tumultuous affairs.[147] A primarily electropop album, its maximalist production experiments with urban styles of hip-hop and R&B.[148][149] Released on November 10, 2017,[150] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[151] and also reached number one in Australia,[152] Canada,[153] and the UK.[154]

Reputation's lead single, "Look What You Made Me Do", topped the Billboard Hot 100 with the highest sales and streaming week of 2017,[155] and was Swift's first UK number-one single.[156] The singles "...Ready for It?", "End Game", and "Delicate" were released to pop radio; all of which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.[157] In 2018, Swift featured on Sugarland's "Babe",[158] surpassed Whitney Houston as the most-awarded female musician at the American Music Awards,[159] and embarked on the Reputation Stadium Tour, which grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[160]
2018–2021: Lover, Folklore, and Evermore

In November 2018, Swift signed a record deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her albums under Republic Records' imprint.[161] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[162][163]

In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[174] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two "sister albums" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11.[175] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced several songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[176] Both albums incorporate muted, atmospheric indie folk and indie rock sounds with orchestrations;[177][178] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore.[179] Folklore and "Cardigan" made Swift the first artist to debut a number-one album and a number-one song in the same week in the US; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and "Willow".[180]

Swift won Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards in 2020[181] and Album of the Year for Folklore at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021, becoming the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times.[182] She played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the original song "Beautiful Ghosts".[183] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and received positive reviews.[184][185]
2021–2023: Re-recordings and Midnights

Swift released two re-recorded albums in 2021: Fearless (Taylor's Version) in April and Red (Taylor's Version) in November. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[186] The latter helped Swift surpass Shania Twain as the female musician with the most weeks at number one on the Top Country Albums chart.[187] The song "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" from Red (Taylor's Version) became the longest song in history to top the Billboard Hot 100.[188]

Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022.[189] The album features a minimalist electropop and synth-pop sound,[190][191] with elements of hip-hop, R&B, and electronica.[189][192] Midnights was Swift's fifth album to open atop the Billboard 200 chart with US first-week sales of one million. Its tracks, led by the single "Anti-Hero", made her the first artist to occupy the entire top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 the same week.[193] The album peaked atop the charts of at least 14 other countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Sweden.[194] Two other singles, "Lavender Haze" and "Karma", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[195]

In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, which she conceived as a tribute to her entire discography. The tour spanned five continents through December 2024.[212] It exerted a global cultural, economic, and political impact and culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity for Swift,[213][214][215] resulting in a phenomenon that the media dubbed "Swiftmania".[216][217] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, with $2 billion in revenue.[218] Its concert film grossed $250 million to become the highest-grossing of its kind,[219] and its photobook sold nearly a million copies in its first week in the US.[220]

During the run of the Eras Tour, there were controversies surrounding Ticketmaster's monopoly that led to political scrutiny in the US,[221] venue mismanagement that lead to a death in Brazil,[222] and Singapore's exclusivity deal that led to political tension in Southeast Asia.[223] In July 2024, three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[224] The following month, the Vienna concerts were canceled following the arrest of suspects who planned a terrorist attack.[225]

Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[226] It became the first album to accumulate one billion streams on Spotify within one week and topped charts of various countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK.[227][228] In the US, The Tortured Poets Department debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 2.6 million first-week units and stayed at number one for 17 weeks, becoming Swift's longest-running number-one album.[229] The album was the global best-seller of 2024, with 5.6 million copies sold.[230] Its songs, led by the single "Fortnight", made her the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 the same week;[227] the second single, "I Can Do It with a Broken Heart", peaked at number three.[231]

Swift began dating the football player Travis Kelce in 2023; their high-profile relationship resulted in their status as a supercouple.[232][233] In January 2024, AI-generated pornographic images portraying Swift in a football context were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[234] On May 30, 2025, Swift finalized the purchase of the masters to her first six original studio albums from Shamrock Holdings, which had acquired them from Braun in 2020.[235] Three months later, Swift announced her twelfth studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, with a release date to be confirmed.[236]

With continuous musical reinventions, Swift was described as a musical "chameleon" by publications such as Time and the BBC.[237][238][239] Her discography spans styles of pop,[240][241] country,[242][243] folk,[244][245] and rock,[246][247] with elements of R&B, hip-hop, and indie pop.[248][249] She self-identified as a country musician with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[250][251] Her influences were female country artists of the 1990s such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, the Dixie Chicks,[252] and Keith Urban's country crossover sound with elements rock, pop, and blues.[253] The albums feature a country pop sound defined by instruments such as six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, a slight twang in Swift's vocals, and pop-rock melodies;[254][255] Speak Now draws on rock styles of the 1970s and 1980s such as pop rock, pop-punk, and arena rock.[88][256] Some critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's songwriting rather than musical style[257][258] and accused her of causing mainstream country to stray away from its roots.[259][260]

After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[261][262] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[263] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums.[264] Reputation consists of hip-hop, R&B, and EDM influences; maximalist arrangements of heavy bass and manipulated vocals; and an emphasis on rhythm.[148][149][265] Lover incorporates eclectic sounds from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[266] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both have a minimalist synth-pop sound characterized by analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[267][268] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded it as an erosion of her country songwriting authenticity,[269] but others considered it necessary for her artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[270][271]

Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, described by some critics as "alternative",[272][273] explore indie folk and rock styles. They incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestrations, muted synthesizers, and drum pads.[177][274][275] Evermore experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[276][277] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's singer-songwriter status and credited her with popularizing "alternative" music, although there were disagreements on this description.[278]

Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[283] but she mostly sings in her alto range.[284][285][286] Reviews of her early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[287] Defenders of Swift appreciated that she refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized intimacy and emotionality to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[288]—a style that critics have described as conversational.[284][289] According to the critic Ann Powers, this singing style is demonstrated through Swift's attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the subtle adjustment of words and phrases to suggest moods like doubt, hope, and intimacy".[284][290]

On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are processed with electronic effects such as synthesizer tweaking, looping, and multitracking, to accompany the pop production.[291][284] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[248][292] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in Folklore[293] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as "breathy and bright" and the lower register as "full and dark".[277]

Reception of Swift's vocals has been more positive since the release of Folklore. The critic Amanda Petrusich commented in 2023 that her singing became richer with stronger clarity and tone, even in live performances.[294] Rolling Stone ranked her 102nd on their 2023 list "200 Greatest Singers of All Time"; the magazine argued that her breathy timbre allows for a broad range of delivery and commented: "A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument."[295] For Powers, Swift's versatile vocals are a result of her evolving artistry, combining "subtle interpolations of hip-hop's cadences and country crooners' relaxed timbre".[248]
Songwriting

Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood; she credited her mother with igniting early interests by helping her prepare for class presentations,[296][297] and would make up lyrics to Disney soundtrack songs once she had run out of words singing them.[298] In her early career, her influences were the country musicians Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[18][94] and the 1990s female singer-songwriters Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette.[299] In later interviews, she listed Joni Mitchell and Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy as additional influences;[300][301] and Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models for their evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[27][302]

Swift considers herself a songwriter first and foremost.[27][303] She divides her lyrics into three types: "quill lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.[304] Using songwriting to cope with personal experiences, her songs are largely autobiographical and feature narratives that mostly revolve around love and romantic relationships.[28][305][306] She would start writing by identifying an emotion she wanted to convey, and the story and melody would follow.[307] Where Taylor Swift and Fearless are rooted in adolescent feelings and detail optimistic romance inspired by fairy tales, Speak Now reflects her young adulthood with newfound wisdom on real-life heartbreak.[308][88] Red explores the tumult of an intense breakup, and 1989 reflects on failed relationships with a wistful perspective; both albums incorporate lyrics that hint at sex, reflecting her personal growth.[285] Swift described Lover as a "love letter to love", inspired by her realization of "love that was very real".[309]

As her career progressed, Swift wrote about self-perception and confrontation against her critics, influenced by fame, sexism, and scrutiny on her personal life by the press.[310] This was first exhibited in Speak Now, which set the precedent to the frantic media speculations on the subjects of Swift's songs, specifically concerning her dating history;[311] Swift considers this practice sexist.[312] Reputation both tackles the public controversies that tarnished her wholesome image and addresses a blossoming romance with intimacy and vulnerability; its extensive references to sex and alcohol set it apart from the youthful innocence that had informed Swift's past albums.[148][313][314] The nocturnal ruminations addressed in Midnights encompass regrets and fantasies, informed by Swift's self-awareness of her fame.[190] The Tortured Poets Department was conceived amidst her heightened fame brought by the Eras Tour and intensely publicized love life during 2023.[315] It explores heartbreak and other themes to the extremes: erotic desires, forbidden love, and escaping from the public spotlight.[249][316]

On Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives, deviating from the autobiographical songwriting that had characterized her artistry.[317] She imposed her emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, inspired by authors and poets of romantic and modernist literature like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Frost, William Wordsworth, and Emily Dickinson;[318][319] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[320] The characters of Folklore and Evermore construct their narratives based on fragments of memory, symbolizing the nature of folktales and oral traditions that pass through time.[321]

Swift considers her songwriting "confessional",[312][322] and academics have connected her style to that of confessional poetry, in that her songs reference personal events and publicize internal feelings to her audience.[306][323] Critical reception of her songwriting has been largely positive,[27][324][325] and her melodic compositions have been highlighted for optimizing the verse-chorus form with memorable bridges.[284][326][327] Several scholars have credited her with taking the confessional singer-songwriter tradition to new heights,[328][329] and she has been variedly described by journalists as a "poet laureate"—of puberty,[27][330] of romance,[331] and of her generation.[332][333] Some critics have dismissed her "confessional" style as material for tabloid gossip.[334] Objection to the perceived poetic value of her songs, mostly from rockist critics, views her as a pop star using literary subtexts as a commercial ploy, with metaphors that are at times imprecise or self-indulgent.[335]

Scholars have attributed criticisms of Swift's songwriting to sexism. The musicologist Travis Stimeling argued that whereas Swift's autobiographical authenticity conforms to country and rock standards, her detractors, mostly male, view her lyrical depictions of a young woman's experiences as trivial and unworthy of serious merit.[336] According to the English-language academic Ryan Hibbett, this gendered criticism bars Swift from receiving full artistic credentials as does Bob Dylan, whose reliance on romantic themes and occasional literary imprecisions are not as harshly criticized.[337] In the views of the literary critic Stephanie Burt, although Swift's writing is not poetry in its traditional sense, it is proficient at "placing inventive, evocative language into pop melodies designed to be sung".[338]
Performances and stage

Swift's concerts are equipped with elaborate settings, incorporating elements from Broadway theatre and high tech.[339][340][341] She does not rely on elaborate choreography and instead emphasizes on connecting emotionally with her audience through storytelling and vocal delivery.[342] Since 2007, she has toured with the same live band.[343] She plays four instruments live: guitar (including electric, acoustic six-string, and twelve-string), six-string banjo, piano, and ukulele.[344][345][346]

Critics have praised her stage presence, stamina,[347][348] and ability to bring forth an intimate atmosphere for her audience, even in stadium settings.[294][349][350] Sasha Frere-Jones, in a 2008 article for The New Yorker, hailed her as a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer who exerted professionalism with a vibrant energy.[258] In Time's 2023 Person of the Year piece, Sam Lansky wrote: "Swift is many things onstage—vulnerable and triumphant, playful and sad—but the intimacy of her songcraft is front and center."[325]
Videos and filmmaking

Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music.[351] She established her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, in 2008.[352] Her directorial debut was the music video for "Mine", co-directed with Roman White, in 2010;[353] and she developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011.[354] For the music videos of the 1989 and Reputation singles, she had an extensive collaboration with the director Joseph Kahn on eight videos;[355] among them, she produced "Bad Blood", which won Best Music Video at the Grammy Awards in 2016.[356] She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[357]

As of May 2025, Swift has directed 13 of her music videos.[358] Her first solo directorial role was for "The Man", which made her the first female artist to win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction.[359] All Too Well: The Short Film marked her filmmaking debut,[193] and it made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a solo director.[360] In June 2023, Swift was invited to the Academy of Motion Pictures.[361] She has cited Joseph Kahn, Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[351][362]

The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry honored her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year five times (2014, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024), more than any other artist.[376] She is the most-streamed artist on Spotify as of February 2024,[377] and the highest-grossing touring act of all time, with cumulative revenue at $3.12 billion as of December 2024.[378] Her chart records include the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist in the 21st century;[379][380] the first artist to occupy the top five of the Australian albums chart, doing so twice,[381][382] and the top 10 of the Australian singles chart;[383] the most entries, most simultaneous entries, and most number-one entries for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200;[384][385] and the first artist to spend 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100.[386]

In the US, Swift has sold 116.7 million album units, including 54 million pure sales, as of May 2025.[387] She is the solo artist with the most weeks at number one on the Billboard 200;[388] the female artist with the most number-one albums on the Billboard 200 (14) and most number-one debuts on the Billboard Hot 100 (7, tied with Ariana Grande);[227] the artist with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay;[389] the first artist to chart five albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200;[390] and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song ("Shake It Off") receive Diamond certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[391] Billboard ranked her at number eight on its list "Greatest of All Time Artists" (2019),[392] number two on "Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century" (2024),[393] and number one on "Top 100 Women Artists of the 21st Century" and "Top Artists of the 21st Century" (both 2025).[394][395]

Swift is an enduring figure of 21st-century popular culture.[239] Her career trajectory from a country singer-songwriter to a pop star in the 2000s and 2010s decades was the subject of extensive commentary.[250][402] Deemed "America's Sweetheart" in her early career, she was described in the press as a "media darling" with a girl next door's polite demeanor and open-hearted conversations.[403][404] Swift displayed a feminine image but refrained from the "aggressively sexualized feminist pop" of her contemporaries, leading publications to comment that her sex appeal was modest, subtle, and sophisticated.[250][405][406] The adolescent themes of Swift's music contributed to her status as a teen idol,[407][408] although several feminist authors took issue with her songs about romantic relationships as narrow-minded and detrimental to girls and women, who made up the majority of her fanbase known as Swifties.[409]

Upon recalibrating her artistry to pop music, Swift has identified as a feminist and achieved a pop icon status.[264][404] The author Jody Rosen in 2013 labelled Swift the "Queen of Pop", citing her popularity that defied traditional boundaries between "genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends".[250] Her feminist identity received contrarian views: there were praises that regarded her success in a male-dominated music industry as an inspiration for girls and women, and criticisms that dismissed her feminist adoption as superficial and self-interested.[410]

The 2016 dispute with Kanye West bolstered the narrative by her detractors that she was a calculating and manipulative woman despite her sweetheart image, and deepened their feud that has resonated in their respective careers.[76][411] Her artistic reinventions in the 2020s decade turned her into an acclaimed singer-songwriter.[272] Buoyed by her enduring pop stardom, she has been recognized as a rare phenomenon that combines the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes with unprecedented success.[328][337]
Legacy

Swift is one of the few artists who consistently sells millions of albums throughout two decades of artistic reinventions despite the industry decline of record sales after the album era had ended.[412][413] In this regard, academics and journalists have described her as "the last pop superstar" and "the last great rock star" of the 21st century.[414][415][416] Her commercial strategies to bolster sales of albums and concert tickets have earned her a reputation as a savvy businesswoman.[417][418][419] The economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an "economic genius".[420] Strategies such as enhanced material for physical album variants and Easter eggs usage in her works became indicative of music marketing trends.[421][422]

Swift's success in country music has been credited with popularizing country beyond the US and introducing the genre to adolescent women, a previously ignored demographic.[250][423][424] The critic Kelefa Sanneh dubbed Swift the biggest country star since Garth Brooks "and maybe since before him, too".[425] Her guitar performances resulted in increasing sales of guitar to women, which the media dubbed the "Taylor Swift factor",[426][427] her transition from country to pop has been credited as the catalyst for poptimism,[428] and her songwriting and musical transitions have been credited with influencing a new generation of artists.[274][424][429] According to Billboard, Swift is one of the few artists who could achieve chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support all the same,[430] and she has the ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[431]

Swift's enduring popularity, particularly to female audiences, contributed to her status as a representation of millennials,[432] or more broadly, her generation's zeitgeist.[433][434] Her fandom Swifties has been described by journalists and academics as one of the most loyal and dedicated.[435][436][437] In the views of Time's Cady Lang, she maintained her superstardom by her "savvy manipulation of both the industry and [her] personal brand".[438] According to the popular-culture scholars Mary Fogarty and Gina Arnold, Swift is arguably the singular artist "whose story encapsulates many of the urgent conflicts in early twenty-first-century American culture".[439] In a 2024 article for The New York Times, Joe Coscarelli wrote that her lasting popularity provoked debates that compared her not only to contemporaries like Drake or Beyoncé, but also to veteran artists like the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Elton John, or Madonna.[440]

Swift's advocacy for artists' rights and re-recording projects have contributed to industry-wide discourses and reforms.[441][442][443] Her artistry and career maneuvers have been the subject of various university courses in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts.[239][444] According to the popular culture scholars Sarai Brinker, Kate Galloway, and Elizabeth Scala, Swift's legacy has been both embraced and critiqued by different affiliations—feminist and queer communities, far-right groups, and religious organizations, and studied by experts in various fields—musicology, literature, sociology, media theory, linguistics, and culture studies.[445]
Wealth and other activities

Swift was listed by Forbes as the world's highest-paid musician in 2016 and 2019,[446][447] the highest-paid female musician of the 2010s decade,[448] and the highest-paid female musician of 2021 and 2022.[449][450] By October 2023, as reported by both Forbes and Bloomberg L.P., Swift achieved her billionaire status. She was recognized as the first billionaire "primarily based on her songs and performances", with the majority of her fortune coming from royalties and touring.[451][452] As of June 2025, her estimated net worth by Forbes stands at $1.6 billion, making her the richest female musician in the world.[451][453] Her real estate portfolio, estimated by Forbes at $110 million as of 2025,[451] consists of residential properties in Nashville, New York City, Los Angeles (Samuel Goldwyn Estate), and Rhode Island (High Watch).[454][455]

Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[456][457] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[458][459] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to the American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks. Media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[460][461] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[462]
Endorsements and partnerships

Swift's album rollouts normally consist of multimedia promotional activities that encompass corporate tie-ins and product endorsements.[463][464] Target is a long-standing business partner with Swift, offering exclusive physical albums and merchandise.[465][466] In 2008–2011, her albums and tours were promoted with self-designed dolls with Jakks Pacific, fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, clothes with L.E.I., and holiday cards with American Greetings.[465][467] Her partnership deals included makeup products for CoverGirl and Cyber-shot cameras for Sony Electronics.[465] In 2012–2015, she had tie-ins with Starbucks, Keds, Subway, Diet Coke, Walgreens, Walmart, and Papa John's.[99][134]

In 2014, New York City named Swift its official tourism ambassador.[468] She had an exclusive streaming deal with Apple Music in 2015,[469] signed a multi-year deal with AT&T in 2016,[470] and partnered with United Parcel Service to distribute her albums in 2017.[404] In 2019, she signed a multi-year deal with Capital One and launched a clothing line with Stella McCartney.[471][472] She became the first global ambassador for Record Store Day, in 2022.[473]
Social activism
Further information: Political impact of Taylor Swift

Swift avoided discussing politics in her early career.[404] In an interview with Time in 2012, she said that she kept herself as educated as possible but did not want to influence other people with her political opinions.[474] Due to her apolitical stance, she was appropriated by the alt-right movement in the US, which sparked controversy.[475] She did express support for president Barack Obama in 2008: "I've never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive."[3]

Since 2018, Swift has been public about her political views and abandoned her once apolitical stance.[404][476] She publicly endorsed two Democratic senators for the 2018 US midterm election, which resulted in headlines about how she finally dissociated herself from the alt-right and conservatives.[475] In interviews, she attributed her political reluctance in the past to the 2003 Dixie Chicks controversy, which left a lasting impact on country musicians at large and female country musicians in particular.[477] She has openly criticized president Donald Trump.[478] In 2020, Swift urged her fans to check their voter registration ahead of elections, which resulted in 65,000 people registering to vote within one day of her post,[479] and endorsed the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the 2020 US presidential election.[480] For the 2024 election, she once again endorsed the Democratic ticket of Harris and Tim Walz.[481]

A pro-choice feminist,[482] Swift is a founding signatory of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment,[483] and she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[484] A supporter of LGBTQ rights, she has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[485][486] In 2019, she called the passing of the Equality Act and performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument.[487][488] Swift has spoke up against white supremacy, racism, and police brutality in the US.[301][482] She has supported the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the US,[489] donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter movement,[490] called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee,[491] and advocated for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.[492]

Swift's political engagements have been met with mixed reception: they have provoked further public discussions on political issues and empowered Swifties, but critics have questioned whether her political alignments were strategic in her career.[493] While some publications have argued that Swift's stardom had a significant impact on political involvements in the US, others have viewed her influence as sizable but overstated.[494][495] According to the popular-culture scholar Simone Driessen, her political impact reached beyond the US to Australia and Europe.[496]
Philanthropy

Swift ranked first on DoSomething's 2015 "Gone Good" list,[497] having received the Star of Compassion from the Tennessee Disaster Services and the Big Help Award from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her "dedication to helping others" and "inspiring others through action".[498][499] Especially early in her career, Swift donated to various relief funds following natural disasters. In 2009, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008.[500] The same year, she performed at Sydney's Sound Relief concert, which raised money for those impacted by bushfires and flooding.[501] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the US, raising more than $750,000.[502] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, she donated $500,000.[503] In 2009, Swift sang at BBC's Children in Need concert and raised £13,000 for the cause.[504] In 2016, she donated $1 million to Louisiana flood relief efforts and $100,000 to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[505][506] Swift donated to food banks after Hurricane Harvey struck Houston in 2017.[507] Swift donated $1 million for Tennessee tornado relief in 2020 and again in 2023,[508][509] as well as $5 million toward the reliefs efforts after Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in 2024.[510]

Swift has also donated to cancer research. As recipient of the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in 2011, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee.[511] In 2012, she participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing the charity single "Ronan", which she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma.[512] She has also donated $100,000 to the V Foundation for Cancer Research[513] and $50,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[514] She has made donations to her fans several times for their medical or academic expenses.[515] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift donated to the World Health Organization and Feeding America[516] and supported independent record stores.[517][518] Swift performed "Soon You'll Get Better" on the One World: Together At Home television special, a benefit concert curated by Lady Gaga for Global Citizen to raise funds for the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.[519]
